<h2> What are "minions"? </h2>
<p>small, yellow, cylindrical creatures who have either one or two eyes with goggles and blue overalls
impulsive creatures with little self-control, but with a wide-eyed wonder and odd innocence that endears them to viewers and makes them relatable</p>

<h2> Creator of "minions" </h2>
<p>Pierre Coffin, a French man who co-directed the first two films in the series and the new films, "Minions"</p>
<p>he also did voices in the film for the three main protagonists: Kevin, Stuart and Bob, plus <p>several hundred other minions as well</p>
<p>he confesses that the minions came about accidentally as he was “doodling a thumbnail cartoon on his children’s attempts at Minion art.”</p>

<h2> Comedy techniques used in the minion movies</h2>
<h1> 1) Incongruity </h1>
<p>it is the juxtaposition of the unusual with the routine which causes us to laugh at things that surprise us by being different or out of place
it is applied to the minions with their unrealistic appearance and their cute but evil actions</p>

<h1> 2) slapstick </h1>
<p>it is another way that Minions use their fun personalities for comedy with their accidents and their actions
Minion movies’ main source of humor and enjoyment comes from the use of non-stop slapstick</p>

<h1> 3) Puns (banana language) </h1>
<p>pun is a type of irony where two words that are similar in sound are deliberately mixed up to poke fun at something
even though the banana language is created by the writer of the movies, the use of the funny language creates its own comedy style</p>
